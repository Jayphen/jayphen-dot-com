 I'm currently <em>unavailable</em> for design or development work, but maybe I can help fix your microwave?

Our friend Jason Fried once said, <em>"the design is done when the problem goes away."</em> Good design starts not in Photoshop, not on paper, and not even in the eye of the designer. Good design starts in a maze in the mind of the user. It is a designer's job to step in to that maze and to find a way out.</p><hr class="paragraph-separator" /></section><section class="what-i-do"><h3>The secret world of Alex Mack</h3><p>The human squints at the glowing rectangle before her.</p><p>A gaggle of designers creeps up behind her chair, careful not to disturb her. They watch her brow furrow as she considers the sign-up form. Her cursor hovers over the word ‘free’, and then darts to a small iconographic representation of the Australian flag. The gaggle inhales. Clicking it, she is teleported to a page that appears to consist <a href="https://www.paypal.com/au/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide">solely of country names and flags.</a></p><img alt="Paypal's languages page" class="paypal" src="https://api.monosnap.com/image/download?id=AfBajIC8UxFuYM9xKJWy5acuHtKruC" /><p>As she clicks on Guadeloupe, each member of the gaggle slowly falls to their knees before <em>melting in to a pool of shimmering silver liquid.</em></p><p>This isn't the end of the story, of course. The designers resolidify in an adjacent room and record their observations from the session.
